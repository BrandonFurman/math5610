## Completed Homework Tasks

### Homework 1

1. Task 1 was to create routines that return machine precision for any computer. Those routines are [smaceps](https://brandonfurman.github.io/math5610/SoftwareManual/OtherRoutines/smaceps) for single precision and [dmaceps](https://brandonfurman.github.io/math5610/SoftwareManual/OtherRoutines/dmaceps) for double precision.
2. Task 2 was to create a github repository.
3. Task 3 was to create this web page. 
4. Task 4 was to create a folder for the software manual.
5. Task 5 was to create a table of contents for the software manual. It can be found [here](https://brandonfurman.github.io/math5610/SoftwareManual/SoftwareManualTableOfContents).
6. Task 6 was to create a shared library containing the routines created in Task 1. It can be found [here]().
7. Task 7 was to use OpenMP to find out how many cores our computers have. The results can be found [here](https://brandonfurman.github.io/math5610/homework/homework1/task7/task7)
8. Task 8 was to write brief paragraphs on three disasters caused by bad numerical computing. Those paragraphs can be found [here]().
9. Task 9 was to create a routine that returns a random matrix of given size. It is entry [randMat](https://brandonfurman.github.io/math5610/SoftwareManual/MatrixOperations/randMat) in the software manual.
10. Task 10 was to discuss current linear algebra packages available. That discussion can be found [here]().

### Homework 2

1. Task 1 has been completed by virtue of this being seen.
2. Task 2 was to create a routine that returns the absolute error between two numbers. This routine is detailed in the [absErr](https://brandonfurman.github.io/math5610/SoftwareManual/OtherRoutines/absErr) entry in the software manual.
3. Task 3 was to create a routine that returns the relative error between two numbers. This routine is detailed in the [relErr](https://brandonfurman.github.io/math5610/SoftwareManual/OtherRoutines/absErr) entry in the software manual.
4. Task 4 was to create a routine to add two vectors of the same length. This routine is detailed in the [addVec](https://brandonfurman.github.io/math5610/SoftwareManual/VectorOperations/addVec) entry in the software manual.
5. Task 5 was to create a routine to multiply a vector by a scalar. This routine is detailed in the [scaleVec](https://brandonfurman.github.io/math5610/SoftwareManual/VectorOperations/scaleVec) entry in the software manual.
6. Task 6 was to create a routine that returns the 2-norm of a given vector. This routine is detailed in the [twoNormVec](https://brandonfurman.github.io/math5610/SoftwareManual/VectorOperations/twoNormVec) entry in the software manual.
7. Task 7 was to create a routine that returns the 1-norm of a given vector. This routine is detailed in the [oneNormVec](https://brandonfurman.github.io/math5610/SoftwareManual/VectorOperations/oneNormVec) entry in the software manual.
8. Task 8 was to create a routine that returns the infinity-norm of a given vector. This routine is detailed in the [infNormVec](https://brandonfurman.github.io/math5610/SoftwareManual/VectorOperations/infNormVec) entry in the software manual.
