## Direct Methods Limitations

Below is a summary of the limitations

- Limitations of LU Decomposition:
	- Could easily be unstable.
	- Does not find approximate solutions.

- Disadvantages of QR compared to LU:
	- More complicated to find QR decomposition
	- Slower than LU

- Limitations of LU Decomposition with partial pivoting:
	- Reduces instability, but in many cases still far from optimal stability
