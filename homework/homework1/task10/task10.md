# Linear Algebra Package Discussion

There are many libraries currently available for solving linear algebra problems. For C++, some of the more popular libraries are [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/), and [Blaze](https://bitbucket.org/blaze-lib/blaze). These packages are designed to be easy to use and tend to be moderately fast. It seems the speed of each package depends heavily on the problem being solved. Specifically, each package tends to be designed around excelling at one particular class of problem. For example, in the case of Eigen, it was designed to compute Y = aX + bY, and so it tends to outperform most other packages at that computation. These packages have some support for multithreading, but overall support seems to be low.

For more general computations that are spread across many cores, Intel and AMD also provide linear algebra packages that are tailored specifically for their CPUs. In particular, Intel provide their [Math Kernel Library](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl) (MKL) and AMD provides their Core Math Library (ACML). Both MKL and ACML tend to be faster for general processes than packages such as Eigen (although their own benchmarks tend to claim otherwise) because they are able to take advantage of CPU specific instruction sets. These packages also tend to scale well with many processor cores.
