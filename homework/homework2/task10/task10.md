# Matrix Norms Discussion

According to [Wolfram Alpha](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MatrixNorm.html), a matrix norm is a number associated with a matrix **A**, denoted by | | **A** | |, that satisfies three axioms. One, the matrix norm should be nonnegative for any matrix **A**. Two, the norm should be absolutely homogeneous. Three, the norm should satisfy both the additive and multiplicative triangle inequalities.

There are several types of matrix norms, but this discussion is restricted to induced matrix norms. A matrix norm induced by a vector
