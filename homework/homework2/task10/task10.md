# Matrix Norms Discussion

According to [Wolfram Alpha](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MatrixNorm.html), a matrix norm is a number associated with a matrix **A** that satisfies three axioms. One, the matrix norm should be nonnegative for any matrix **A**. Two, the norm should be absolutely homogeneous. Three, the norm should satisfy both the additive and multiplicative triangle inequalities.

There are several types of matrix norms, but this discussion is restricted to induced matrix norms. A matrix norm induced by a vector ... In the OCW MIT lectures on [Dynamic Systems](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-241j-dynamic-systems-and-control-spring-2011/readings/MIT6_241JS11_chap04.pdf), the induced 2-norm is defined. They describe this norm as measuring the "amplification" a matrix **A** provides to vectors.
