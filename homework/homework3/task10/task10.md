# Frobenius Norm Discussion

According to [Wolfram Alpha](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FrobeniusNorm.html), the Frobenius norm is defined as the square root of the sum of the absolute squares of its elements. Alternatively, the Frobenius norm is also equal to the square root of the trace of product of a matrix and its conjugate transpose.
